Cryptocurrency will drive the development of blockchain and provide an incentive mechanism, and its value also represents the value of blockchain. Blockchain technology can be considered as an accounting method and a form of database preservation. Blockchain technology essentially eliminates third-party institutions. Blockchain is a data structure (stack and queue are also data structures).</span></p>

Bitcoin is a digital currency made by using this technology. With the whole cryptocurrency market hitting a record high, from "tax-free passport" to "high-value assets", various applications of blockchain have attracted people's attention again. We expect to see more application of blockchain technology in supply chain and sustainable procurement, especially in the mining and metal industries. From finance to cloud storage, the demand for more decentralized infrastructure may increase. COVID-19 also pushed forward the exploration of the technology of blockchain by the central bank's digital currency. More countries began to try to use digital currency under the influence of the epidemic. For example, China continued to push forward DCEP (digital currency / electronic payment). The Chinese people's Bank of China has completed a pilot project in Shenzhen, Xiong An and Suzhou, and handled 1 billion 100 million yuan in 3 million 100 thousand transactions. (China's National Digital Currency DCEP / CBDC Overview, 2021) </span>.</p>

For example, inaccurate information of airport inbound passengers is usually the main reason for virus transmission, because it is difficult for the airport to track and verify all transfer information and the number of passengers per passenger.

The system is completely open and transparent. The account books are open to everyone to realize data sharing, and anyone can check the accounts. At the same time, the blockchain also has irrevocable, tamper proof and encryption security, because the blockchain adopts a one-way hash algorithm and each newly generated block advances in strict chronological order. The irreversibility and irreversibility of time make any attempt to invade and tamper with the data information in the blockchain easy to be traced, resulting in exclusion by other nodes and high counterfeiting cost, Thus, the relevant wrongful acts can be limited. Cryptocurrency may become the digital currency used by people in large transactions. The impact of the epidemic on countries around the world will make these situations possible.</span></p>

If developed well, the movement will not bring the next large pyramid grading system that is controlled and opaque.

In many parts of the world, people's wealth is stored in items such as livestock or land, rather than traditional financial instruments or institutions. By using blockchain technology and blockchain-based currency, a person's identity becomes a digital identity because some of their wealth is stored in assets linked to the blockchain. In doing so, they suddenly have access to services they could not access before. In turn, banks and other financial institutions are more interested in transactions with them and may provide loans to them because they clearly understand who this person is and how their financial situation is. At the same time, another increasingly widespread use of blockchain is information storage and control. Today, our personal information (search history, medical records, fitness tracking data) is controlled and monetized by third parties. If our personal information is stored on the blockchain and connected to our digital identity, we will control who can access it. This will enable individuals to sell or lease their information and gain value in return. At the same time, such a system also provides a more secure defense against identity theft without third-party monitoring. Blockchain is security and monitor. Blockchain will change the world of Finance and personal security. With the surge of data generated through the Internet of things and networking devices, and micro transmission has increasingly become a reality in daily life, blockchain will become the basic component of the whole new world of digital interaction and trading.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'335551550':6,'335551620':6}"> </span></p>

However, due to the immature technology, cryptocurrency has no great impact on my daily life for people who have no capital level. In ordinary transactions, the traditional currency is used as usual, and it will not affect my family, perhaps cryptocurrency can better affect the country or people with certain financial capacity. For my friend, it obtains a small amount of money by buying and selling bitcoin, but it has no great impact on his life. The application of blockchain systems in all aspects of life, such as airport, medical and health care, can make my life and my family more convenient. Blockchain can establish digital proof that cannot be tampered with. New authentication mechanisms can be established in the fields of digital copyright, intellectual property, certificates, and public welfare to improve the management level of public services. The medical industry has begun to adopt blockchain technology in various aspects, such as protecting the privacy of medical records and ensuring the integrity of medical data (such as MRI results) sent over the Internet. At the same time, another social change brought about by blockchain is the arrival of the era of the real sharing economy. People are looking forward to the era of direct transaction and sharing based on trust. If a person has competitive data, it can be shared on the blockchain platform without passing through a third-party organization.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'335551550':6,'335551620':6}"> </span></p>
