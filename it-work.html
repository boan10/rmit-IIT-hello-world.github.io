					<p>This part is an interview with an IT professional from ByteDance company. During the interview, we can learn about the real IT world, understand the specific IT work and how does people work in real industry. We can also know where the IT professional spends the most time during his work as well as know what is the most challenging part of his work for him.

					<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional? 

					</h2>
					<p>The job of this IT professional is Quality Assurance. He is working in Byte-Dance which is the company create the famous application called Tik-Tok. Compared with the testing, his work focuses more on the development of testing tools. So, his job is testing, finding the bugs in the project and developing test tools to help better testing. </p>

					<h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are the other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h2>
					<p>The people who interact with him at work must be other IT professionals.  

						Because communication with colleagues at work is indispensable, as a test tool developer, he needs to design requirements based on feedback from other testers, and modify requirements and update tools based on feedback from testers after using the tool.  
						
						In his daily life, he also interacts with many IT professionals, because his friends at the university are basically students of the same major, and he keeps in touch with them after graduation. In this case, what everyone communicates is more about the current situation of the whole IT industry.

					<h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time</h2>
					<p>Most of the time at work is spent communicating with colleagues. Because his main job is to develop test tools, these test tools are provided to test colleagues to use, so he should optimize the tools based on the feedback of colleagues, and improve the experience of colleagues using tools. Another important part is maintaining the product, this part is not only coding and producing new features but also code review and rebuilding code in order to improve the efficiency of the tools. In addition, he should spend a lot of time debugging. In actual work, after being familiar with the business, the time to actually write the code is not as much as the time to debug. Because the requirements are based on modules, but when the amount of code for the entire business is very large, debugging is for the entire business. Although there may be no problem with a single module, it takes more time to debug in the overall environment. </p>

					<h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging</h2>
					<p>The most challenging part for him is invoking badly documented service. This process requires many approval steps. The difficulty is that even if it runs following the handbook, it may not be able to successfully call the service. This may be an unavoidable link in the industry. When the company has a large volume and many business lines, the business modules are closely connected, and it is difficult for developers to write all the code independently. Invoking a service is an indispensable step. It may not be too difficult to operate, but some services cannot be easily accessed directly. In fact, it takes time to learn something unfamiliar. When this step is cumbersome and essential, people may need to spend a lot of time learning this step, but this step has no actual output. Leaders always examined the outputs and results, so in this case, these steps may not be challenges but rather frustrating. Time spent in other aspects are relatively more expected, such as coding, debugging, even overcoming technical difficulties. When he spends time doing these, he feels like following the tracks. When the difficulties and time costs are expected, they feel less challenging, because people schedule time for those. On the other hand, unexpected time costs will increase the risk in delivering on time. Makes the work more challenging in another way. </p>
